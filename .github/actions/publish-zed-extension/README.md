# publish-zed-extension

Composite GitHub Action that opens or updates a PR in
[`zed-industries/extensions`](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions)
to bump this extension's submodule pointer and version.

## Why this exists (vs. `huacnlee/zed-extension-action`)

The upstream `huacnlee/zed-extension-action` creates a new branch with a
timestamped name on every run (`update-<ext>-<unix-time>`), which means
re-running the publish step opens a duplicate PR every time instead of updating
the in-flight one.

This action uses a deterministic branch name (`bump-<ext>-<version>`) and
checks for an existing open PR before deciding whether to create a new one or
force-push the existing branch. Net effect: **at most one open PR per version,
ever** — re-runs update the existing PR.

## Inputs

| Name              | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `extension-name`  | yes      | Name as registered upstream (e.g., `laravel`).                              |
| `version`         | yes      | Version without `v` prefix. A tag `v<version>` must exist on the source repo. |
| `push-to`         | yes      | Fork of `zed-industries/extensions` to push to (e.g., `mike-bronner/extensions`). Must already exist. |
| `upstream-repo`   | no       | Defaults to `zed-industries/extensions`.                                    |
| `committer-token` | yes      | PAT with `repo` + `workflow` scopes on the fork.                            |
| `signing-key`     | no       | SSH private key for signing commits. Public key must be on the PAT owner's GitHub account as a *Signing Key*. |

## Behavior

1. Looks up any open PR from `<fork-owner>:bump-<ext>-<version>` to upstream.
2. Clones the fork, syncs its default branch with upstream (force-push), then
   builds the bump branch fresh from upstream's default branch.
3. Initializes the `extensions/<ext>` submodule, fetches tag `v<version>`,
   checks it out.
4. Updates `version = "<version>"` inside the `[<ext>]` section of
   `extensions.toml` (scoped — won't touch other entries).
5. Commits both changes if anything actually changed (idempotent).
6. Force-pushes the bump branch.
7. Creates a new PR if none existed, otherwise the force-push updates the
   existing PR automatically.

## Prerequisites

- Fork `zed-industries/extensions` to the `push-to` owner.
- Ensure the fork's `.gitmodules` for `extensions/<ext>` points at the source
  repo (true by default if the fork was made cleanly).
- Add a `ZED_PUBLISHING_TOKEN` repo secret with a PAT that has `repo` +
  `workflow` scopes. This repo's `release.yml` also uses it as the push token
  for the version-bump commit (in place of a separate `OWNER_PAT`), so the PAT
  must have write access to **both** the source repo and the `push-to` fork. A
  classic PAT owned by the account that owns both covers this automatically; a
  fine-grained PAT must list both repos with Contents + Workflows = Read/Write.
- Push tag `<version>` (or `v<version>`) to the source repo *before* this
  action runs. The script auto-detects which form exists. In this repo's
  `release.yml`, the `update-version` job handles that and `publish` depends
  on it.
- (Optional) For signed/verified commits: generate a dedicated SSH key,
  register the public key on the PAT owner's GitHub account under *Settings →
  SSH and GPG keys* with **Key type: Signing Key**, and store the private key
  as the `COMMIT_SIGNING_SSH_KEY` secret. Without this, commits will appear
  as "Unverified" on GitHub.

## Usage

```yaml

    version: ${{ needs.update-version.outputs.new_version }}
    push-to: mike-bronner/extensions
    committer-token: ${{ secrets.ZED_PUBLISHING_TOKEN }}
```
